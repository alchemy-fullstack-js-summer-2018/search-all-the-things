        <p id="app-bio">&apos;Search all the books!&apos; is an app made by us, Robert Thompson and Mariah Adams, as part of their education at Alchemy Code Lab, a Portland based technology school. This app is an SPA using the React Router and the Google Books API to allow the user to search for books under a multitude of criteria. Additionally, we use Firebase&apos;s Realtime Database to store the users favorites, allowing us to make a highly responsive favoriting system. If you would like to learn more about this app, or would like to give it a try for yourself, please visit the <a href='https://github.com/MariahAdams/search-all-the-things'>Github</a> page and take a look at the README!</p>
